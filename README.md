Fast Beam alignment for 6g
--------------------------

Future data-hungry 6G applications such as holographic telepresence, wireless extended reality, and
autonomous vehicles are expected to be supported by higher frequency bands, e.g., millimeter wave
and terahertz bands. However, these bands suffer from high penetration loss through blockages. To
this end, multi-antenna base station (BS) can be used to establish line-of-sight reflection links,
thereby ensuring reliable communications. This requires efficient beam alignment to identify the
optimal beams at the base station maximize the achievable communication rate.


Conventional beam alignment methods require a large beam training overhead. The challenge of this project is
to consider the trade-off between communication rate and beam training overhead, and understand
the impact of different system parameters on beam alignment. This would include a study of the state-
of-art work, combined with simulations of different scenarios and various machine learning
algorithms.


This project aims at developing a novel machine learning-based scheme to achieve a good beam
alignment performance with a small amount of beam training overhead.
